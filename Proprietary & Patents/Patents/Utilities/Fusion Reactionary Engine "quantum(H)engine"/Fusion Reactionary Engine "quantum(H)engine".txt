The continuous career & work of designing a self sustained nuclear fusion reaction engineered utility
 by Dr. Thomas Catalano, he designed & built the utility in AD 2012, 
the Fusion Reactionary Engine produces a continuous power output by a metallurgical circuit,
 magnetism pressure reciprocates ion mass density hydrogen(H) from water(H20) in area(n) 
generates frequency at upwards of 2.5_Tera-Hertz a second in equal opposition yielding ionization of 
mass density to ~0~ point nuclear fusion reaction by were a total conversion factor is upwards of 2.5_Tera-Watts per second.
