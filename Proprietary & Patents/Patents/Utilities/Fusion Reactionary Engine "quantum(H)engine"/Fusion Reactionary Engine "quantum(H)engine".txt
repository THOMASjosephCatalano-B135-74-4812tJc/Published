Fusion Reactionary Engine "quantum(H)engine" continuous power output of a engineered system by Thomas Catalano 
by where reciprocating ion mass density hydrogen(H) from water(H20) in area(n)
generates frequency at 2.5 - 3.0 Tera-Hertz a second in equal opposition 
yielding ionization of mass density to 0 point local per second
a total conversion factor can be applied equivalent to 2.5 - 3.0 Tera-Watts per second.
