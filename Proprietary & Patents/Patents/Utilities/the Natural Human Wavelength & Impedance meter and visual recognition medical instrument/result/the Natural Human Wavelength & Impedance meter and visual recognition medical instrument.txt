A designed utility formulated by the proven calculation of 
the wavelength and it's interactions with all matter.
A clear containment/open "tub" filled with translucent fluid ie. Water
with a basin of contrasting sheet ie. copper at voloume per required
visual registering area to view then by sequencing a calculated/timed 
pulse width modulation to oscillate the "water" at frequency 60hZ per 
aspect ratio 1:1. Overlayed video to the visual recognition module coupled 
to a measurement "reader" confirms the "object" being visual registered to view
wavelength plus the undeniable wavelength's not naturally occurring(there is only one 
wavelength that is static for all living human beings(and encapsulated wavelength) 
and/or objects per say that all have static resonate frequencies.)
seen and measured.
