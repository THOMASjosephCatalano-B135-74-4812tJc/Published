A designed utility formulated by the proven calculation of 
the wavelength and it's interactions with all matter.
A clear containment/open "tub" filled with translucent fluid ie. Water
with a basin of contrasting sheet ie. copper at voloume per required
visual registering area to view then by sequencing a calculated/timed 
pulse width modulation to oscillate the "water" at frequency 60hZ per 
aspect ratio 1:1.
