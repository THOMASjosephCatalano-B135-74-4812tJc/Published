Title of Invention:Fusion Reactionary Engine; 
bi-polarizing centrifuge core 
a mast anode/cathode assembly 
to "Earth like"(Nitrogen/Oxygen)atmospheric pressurized graphite/carbon(ized) inner-liner chamber 
connected to a gas exchange/regulating cell module 
with hydrostatic metering plained 
on a tensioning spring sproket set timed pendulum planetary gear set 
attached inner static(izing) swing arm(s)(the main prop fly-by arm eccentric stabilizer and central 
fugue neutralize bowel)
via "Earth" inner chamber by-passing to electrical power storage/regulator/output module.
