Nuclear Fusion Reactor; continuous self-sustain nuclear fusion power generation via connecting fusion core by metallurgical circuit and floating antenna ground, Neodymium Iron Boron (NdFeB) magnetism pressure and nickel(Ni) stabilizer reciprocates ion mass density hydrogen(H) from water(H20) in area(n) generates frequency at upwards of 2.5_Tera-Hertz a second in equal opposition yielding ionization of mass density to ~0~ point nuclear fusion reaction which produces upwards of 2.5_Tera-Watts per second.
