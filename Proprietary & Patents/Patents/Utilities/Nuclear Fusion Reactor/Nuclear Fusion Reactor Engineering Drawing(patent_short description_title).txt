Nuclear Fusion Reactor; self-sustain nuclear fusion continuous 
power generation by a metallurgical circuit, magnetism pressure 
reciprocates ion mass density hydrogen(H) from water(H20) in area(n) 
generates frequency at upwards of 2.5_Tera-Hertz a second in equal 
opposition yielding ionization of mass density to ~0~ point nuclear 
fusion reaction which produces upwards of 2.5_Tera-Watts per second.
