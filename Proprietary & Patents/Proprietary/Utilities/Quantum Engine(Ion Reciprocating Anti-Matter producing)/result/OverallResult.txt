With the Fusion Reactionary Engine, Quantum(H)Engine's continuous power output of a engineered system by Thomas Catalano 
by where reciprocating ion mass density hydrogen(H) from water(H20) in area(n) 
generates frequency at 2.5 - 3.0 Tera-Hertz a second in equal opposition 
yielding ionization of mass density to ~0~ point fusion reaction per second
a total conversion factor can be applied equivalent to 2.5 - 3.0 Tera-Watts per second.
