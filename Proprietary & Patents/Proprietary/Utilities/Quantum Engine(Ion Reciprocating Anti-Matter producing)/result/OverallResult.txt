With the Quantum Engines continuous power output of a engineered system by Thomas Catalano by where reciprocating
ion mass density hydrogen(H) from water(H20) in area(n) yields frequency at 2.5 - 3.0 Tera-Hertz a second and ionization of mass density to a 0 point local per second a total conversion factor can be applied equivalent to 2.5 - 3.0 Tera-Watts per second.
