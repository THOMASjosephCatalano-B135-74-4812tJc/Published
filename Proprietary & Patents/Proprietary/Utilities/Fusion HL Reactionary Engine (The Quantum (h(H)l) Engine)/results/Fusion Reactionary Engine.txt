The Fusion Reactionary Engine "quantum (h(H)l) engine" is the culmination of the
original quantum(H)Engine(ie. Low pressure system at 2.5_Tera-Watts) combined with the
high pressure engine in an enclosed housing core with atmospheric("Earth like" N/O) gas 
state at a continuous timed pendulum planetary gear-set that generates 2.5_Tera-Watts of electrical current.
